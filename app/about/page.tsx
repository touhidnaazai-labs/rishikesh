              Rishikesh is a place where people come for many different reasons —
              to experience the Ganga, explore the city, spend time with family,
              visit spiritual destinations, or simply take a break from everyday
              life.

              Hotel Chandreshwar is designed as a simple and welcoming base for

              Dayanand Ashram Road, the hotel offers AC and Non-AC double-bed
              rooms with attached bathrooms and hot water.
